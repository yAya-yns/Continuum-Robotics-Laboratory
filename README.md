Long and Thin Continuum Robot: Properties and Stablization Mechanisms

My original investigation paper and presentation slides can be found in the repository.


  In navigating and inspecting in complex environments, continuum robots can target positions that traditional robots cannot reach. In this application, long and thin continuum robots are desirable. However, withstand its self-weight and controlling such a robot is challenging. We proposed a tendon-driven continuum robot which is 710 mm long and 14 mm in diameter thin. We evaluated the real robot in different scenarios.Theresultofthestudyrevealsthatacontinuumrobot with a length-diameter ratio of over 50 can navigate through complex environments and hold payloads beyond 0.5 times its weight.
